# Product Search API – Spring Boot & Frontend Integration

Product Search API is a beginner-friendly full-stack web application designed to demonstrate how a REST API works in a real-world product search scenario, similar to an e-commerce platform.

The project focuses on backend API flow, database interaction, and frontend integration using simple and clear concepts.

---

## Project Summary

In real-world applications such as e-commerce platforms, users search for products and instantly receive details like price, rating, and availability.

This project simulates that workflow by allowing users to search for food/products from a frontend interface, fetching data through a Spring Boot REST API, retrieving results from a database, and displaying them back to the user in a clean UI.

The primary goal is to practically explain how REST APIs function end-to-end.
